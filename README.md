# DVDManagerGUI (Project Created for CS 401 - Software Engineering)
This project aims to simulate a DVD Collection. You can add, delete, modify existing dvds, and even get the total run time of your collection. It does all this in a GUI UI that utilizes JOptionPane API

If you wish to use this, you will need to somehow have access to the javax.swing library that has access to the JOptionPane API. You can use the Eclipse IDE for this since it will most likely have the dependency you want.

Afterwards you can generate a new one by simply entering a name for the file. Or alternatively, you can add DVDs to your collection already by adding DVDs and their respective details inside a .txt file in the following format: <name of DVD>,<rating>,<number that simulates total run time>

This program will add a DVD to your simulated collection by separating the Name, Rating, and total run time respectively, each of this being entered and modified by you.
Afterwards, you will have the option to either add more DVDs to your collection, modify an existing DVD, getting DVDs by their ratings alongside showing a picture of their rating, or getting the total run time of every DVD within your collection respectively.
